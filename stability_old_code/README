this code is meant for use in part 3 of the phd courses.
I have implemented a version that combines channel and boundary 
layer. It uses chebdif and not the expantion coefficient form as 
schmid has used. The energy is computed by INTweights and ENER. 
I modified Schmids nlize and called it normalize, also I modified 
qbmat and called it QBmat. These changes were done to satisfy the 
form that I am used to, and which is tested in cooperation with 
the chebdif package. Otherwise the optimal function is unaltered.
